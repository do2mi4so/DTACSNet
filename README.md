This repo contains an open implementation to run inference with DTACSNet models for atmospheric correction. The trained models
provided here are customized to the band configuration that will be available in Phi-Sat-II. **This repo and trained models are released under a** [Creative Commons non-commercial licence](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/legalcode.txt)
